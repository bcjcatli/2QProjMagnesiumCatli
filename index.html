        <h4>Zutto Mayonaka de Iinoni shortened to ZUTOMAYO is a Japanese Band the debuted in 2018. Despite the band's secretive nature, the group is very successful. For me I think it's because of the vocals by ACA-Ne that made this band very successful, along with that the band also produces amazing sounds to go along with ACA-Ne's already good voice.

        <h4>Yorushika is a Japanese band/duo. This group is composed of N-buna, formerly known for their Vocaloid works and Suis a vocalist. The group was founded in 2017. You might know them for providing the Theme (Hana ni Bourei) and Ending song (Usotsuki) for A Whisker Away. For me, it's the brilliant sounds that N-buna can create and Suis' flexible voice is what makes them a really effective duo. Click on the Artist name to learn more!</h4>
