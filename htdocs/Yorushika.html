            <h4>Yorushika is really one of my favorite artists because of the stories that their songs portray. Suis' voice is really inspiring and n-buna's music is breathtaking. You might have heard some of their works from the animated movie "A Whisker Away" as they were the ones who sang the theme songs of it.</h4>

            <h4>Hitchcock is about a person who is lost because they don't know what dream to pursue. They just want to live their life like how they spend summers. Filled with joy and the things they love. They are terrified of the future because they do not know what it brings and they don't have any plans to face it. They do not want to spend the rest of their lives being a building block for society when they already used their adolescence living as a student.</h4>

            <h4>This song is about a person who once envied people that has both fame and money and he strived to be like them. After some time, he actually became successful because of the masks that he put on just to please people. Over time, he regretted his actions and decided to remove the mask and show his true self but before he knew it, the masks became a part of his character. He became a husk that only acts to please others and that depressed him but he didn't have a choice so he accepted it as a part of himself.</h4>

            <h4>This is about a man who loved music very much and one day he decided to make music. To make music he must steal; steal melodies, sounds, poetry, ideas, it does not matter if it's stolen or not. All he wants is for his music to be the best.</h4>
