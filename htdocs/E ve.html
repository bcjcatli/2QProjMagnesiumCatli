            <h4>E ve is a singer-songwriter and was also a vocaloid producer. His works are featured in several Japanese Animations like "Jujutsu Kaisen" and "Josee, the Tiger and the Fish". What I really love about E ve's voice is how it somehow feels like the feelings of the songs emanate from his singing voice.</h4>
